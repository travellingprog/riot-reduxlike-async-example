# Notes

## To Do

- add comments
- add redux-like middleware, with logger
- add logger only for dev build
- make logger (or the store?) keep the last 50 actions. dev only
- Create prod task
- beef up package.json


## Using Browserify

Use riotify + browserify-incremental, to speed up the build process


## Using rollup.js

Could write things as ES2015 modules
