# Riot, Redux-like, Minimal Async Application

In this project, I'm recreating Redux's [async example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/async), but I'm using [Riot](http://riotjs.com/), my own Redux-like Flux implementation and I'm **not** using any module bundler (like Webpack or Browserify).

This is a proof of concept for the sake of research, and this is basically a follow-up to the research I did with my [Interview Generator](https://github.com/travellingprog/interview-generator) application.

## Install And Run

This project is meant to be run with Node v6 and the latest version of Yarn.

## Research Purpose

## Findings

Missing in Dev UX:
- sourcemaps for our components (because of Riot compiler)
- PropTypes
- redux logger with tons of options


## Possible Future Improvements

- create time-travel middleware
- add a code linter
